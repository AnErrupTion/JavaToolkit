# JavaToolkit
A **Java library** that will **speed up** your development.<br/>
**JavaToolkit** is made to **integrate C# features and methods**. Java **always shared things in common** with C#, so **why not vice-versa?**<br/><br/>
Features include :<br/>
- Getting all matches of a regex from input
- Working with files with ease
- Making requests with the new Java 11 HttpClient
- ANSI color codes and a Console class with a LogType class (Info, warning, error)
- Working with arrays (removing duplicates, conversion)
- **And more!**

# Requirements
**IDE** IntelliJ IDEA 2020.3<br/>
**OpenJDK** 11
